The train traveled to Aldgate Station before West's body finally toppled off. Backtracking to the criminal's apartment, Holmes finds a series of classified ads from <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> stashed away. All are under the name Pierrot: \"Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.\"</p>\n        </section>\n        <section id='telegraph'>\n          <h3>The Daily Telegraph</h3>\n          <p>Holmes and Watson head to The Daily Telegraph and place an ad to draw out the criminal. It reads: \"To-night. Same hour. Same place. Two taps. Most vitally important. Your own safety at stake.
